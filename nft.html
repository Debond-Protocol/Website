                    D/BOND is above all a community whose aim is to bring real change to DeFi. We have developed the
                    ERC/3475 standard to achieve this — making investments safer and more stable.

                    Unlike other DeFi projects like SnapShot, we do not only poll our community. D/BOND makes
                    transparent, community-led, decentralised governance possible on our comprehensive platform.
