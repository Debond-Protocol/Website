                        Decentralised Finance (DeFi) markets are extremely volatile today.
                        In traditional finance (TradFi), bonds play a stabilising role with their predictable yields.<br/>
                        We have created the ERC-3475 protocol, to make investments safer
                        and more stable in DeFi.
